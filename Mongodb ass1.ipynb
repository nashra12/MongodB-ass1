    "Q1: What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database, storing data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Non-relational databases, unlike SQL databases, don't rely on a fixed schema. MongoDB is preferred for handling large volumes of unstructured data, real-time analytics, and applications requiring flexible schema designs.\n",
    "Q2: State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features of MongoDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Document-Oriented: Data stored as JSON-like documents.\n",
    "    Scalability: Horizontal scaling through sharding.\n",
    "    Flexibility: Dynamic schema for unstructured data.\n",
    "    High Performance: Fast read/write operations.\n",
    "    Replication: Data redundancy and high availability via replica sets.\n",
    "    Indexing: Efficient query execution with secondary indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "from pymongo import MongoClient\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "client = MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017/')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a database\n",
    "db = client['mydatabase']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a collection\n",
    "collection = db['mycollection']\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Database and collection created successfully.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record, and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "record = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25, \"city\": \"New York\"}\n",
    "collection.insert_one(record)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "records = [\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 30, \"city\": \"San Francisco\"},\n",
    "    {\"name\": \"Charlie\", \"age\": 35, \"city\": \"Boston\"}\n",
    "]\n",
    "collection.insert_many(records)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find one record\n",
    "print(collection.find_one({\"name\": \"Alice\"}))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find all records\n",

    "Q5: Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The find() method retrieves documents matching a query from a collection. It returns a cursor to iterate through the matching documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Query documents where age is greater than 25\n",
    "query = {\"age\": {\"$gt\": 25}}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute the query\n",
    "results = collection.find(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the results\n",
    "for doc in results:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sort() method orders query results based on specified fields. It accepts a dictionary of fields with their sort order (1 for ascending, -1 for descending).\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort documents by age in ascending order\n",
    "results = collection.find().sort(\"age\", 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print sorted results\n",
    "for doc in results:\n",
    "    print(doc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    delete_one(): Removes the first document matching a filter.\n",
    "    delete_many(): Removes all documents matching a filter.\n",
    "    drop(): Deletes an entire collection, removing all documents and indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
